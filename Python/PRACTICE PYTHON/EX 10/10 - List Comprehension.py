# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution
# in a different way.
#
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
#
# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
# (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python
# using at least one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).
#
# The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python, but a few readers
# pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can
# either choose to use the original directive and read about the set command in Python 3.3, or try to implement this on
# your own and use at least one list comprehension in the solution.
#
# Extra:
#
# Randomly generate two lists to test this
